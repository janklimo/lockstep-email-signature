## Getting Started

This is a simple HTML file with some CSS styles, no setup is required.

Clone the repo, edit `index.html` and `styles.css` as desired and you're
ready to copy your signature to Gmail.

While Gmail doesn't let you paste HTML into your signature, you can copy
and paste a portion of an HTML page which will copy styles as well.

Once you are done editing your signature, highlight it:

Go to `Settings - General - Signature` and paste the copied content.
You're done!

## Images

Note that images need to be hosted on a remote server, so that you can
copy-paste them to Gmail.

Make sure to have your images in 2x the rendered resolution, so that the
quality doesn't suffer on retina screens. E.g. given that the logo has styles
`width: 50px; height: 100px;`, make sure your image dimensions are 100 x 200.
