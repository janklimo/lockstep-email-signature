## Getting Started

This is a simple HTML file with some CSS styles, no setup is required.

Clone the repo, edit `index.html` and `styles.css` as desired and you're
ready to copy your signature to Gmail.

While Gmail doesn't let you paste HTML into your signature, you can copy
and paste a portion of an HTML page which will copy styles as well.

Once you are done editing your signature, highlight it:
